# DEVLOG — Empowr Members

## 2026-07-06

- Project plan written from the Empowr CIC KB (sessions entity + sessions-booking source) — scope, stack, data model, four build phases, open questions
- Project scaffolded via /init-mwp-developer — plan content folded into planning/spec/, planning/architecture/, and planning/decisions/
- Workspace routing tables updated (F:\Projects\CLAUDE.md, F:\Projects\CONTEXT.md, Empowr CIC/CONTEXT.md)
- Parent Empowr CIC repo .gitignore updated with `Empowr Members/`; local git repo initialised on `main`, first commit made
- Pushed to new private remote github.com/Pecuvate/empowr-members; registered in _config/registry/github.md
- Execution plans written for all phases 0–4 under planning/phases/ (restructured from planning/phase-0/) — each with done-when criteria, ordered steps, decision gates, and exclusions
- Coverage review in phases/CONTEXT.md maps every aim component to a phase; caught 4 gaps (GDPR account deletion → P3, Wix customer migration comms → P4, session reminders → P3, business-rule gate → P1 Step 1); 9 ADRs total logged
- Next: execute Phase 0 — Step 1 /init-brand, Step 2 mem_ schema migration, Step 3 Auth config, Step 4 Netlify + domain
